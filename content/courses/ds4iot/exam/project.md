The practical part of the exam consists of two steps:

- The discussion of the project
	- Select a topic
	- Study of the state-of-art solutions (Edge/Fog, Cloud, IoT) related to the selected topic.
	- Modeling and Simulation using iFogSim:
		- compare different configurations selecting the best one, according to your needs
		- a comparison of the obtained results is required in terms of:
			- Latency
			- Network usage
			- Energy consumption
	- Implement some functionalities of the modeled system using frameworks provided by Eclipse IoT, focusing on different layers (e.g. client and server side MQTT-based communication using Eclipse Paho and Mosquitto respectively).
	- Write a report and deliver it at least three days before the exam.
	- Prepare a presentation that will help you explain, during the exam, the work done in your project.

- An oral exam: one question for each lecture (available [here](/lectures/))


The **deadline** for delivering the projects is **7 days** before the exam.
